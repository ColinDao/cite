## Project Description

This project implements Google's PageRank algorithm, a cornerstone of web search, which measures the importance 
of pages by analyzing their hyperlink structure. It offers two distinct methods: random sampling and iterative computation 
for estimating PageRank scores. By leveraging both methods, this project provides a comprehensive solution for analyzing and 
ranking web pages within a given corpus by their probability of being visited.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/colindao/cite-your-sources.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd cite-your-sources
```

3. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To analyze a corpus' pages, run the following command:

```bash
python pagerank.py [corpus]
```

Adjust the sampling size and damping factor to tinker with how many random iterations you'd like to execute and the likelihood of choosing a link on that page.

## Features


**Random Sampling**: The random sampling method begins by selecting a page randomly from the corpus. Utilizing a transition model and Markov Chain, 
the current page's state transitions to a random link within that page. The visits per page are recorded and accumulate throughout the total sample iterations, 
providing a model of the probability distribution as if a random internet surfer were navigating the web.<br />
<br />
**Iterative Sampling**: In the iterative sampling approach, PageRank values are computed based on previous iterations. 
Initially, each page is assigned an equal probability scoreâ€”that is choosing one randomly. Then, using a recursive mathematical expression derived from the PageRank algorithm, 
the probability score for each page is updated based on the PageRank values of its parent pages. This process continues iteratively until the 
PageRank values converge to stable values which deviate by less than 0.1%. By refining the PageRank values with each iteration, the iterative sampling method provides an accurate 
estimation of the importance of each page within the corpus.
